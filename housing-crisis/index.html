<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul><li>Traditional Housing is Expensive</li>
<li>Travel Trailers are Cheaper</li>
<li>The Internet and Mobile Apps Exist</li>
<li>Travel Trailer + Internet App = Housing that is<ul><li>Movable</li>
<li>Resizable</li>
<li>Variable-Expense</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
Housing has become unaffordable for 
    many people worldwide. Governments are unable to
    fix this because there is a demographic of people
    that benefit from this situation - current homeowners
    the NIMBYs (not in my back yard). Concurrently, there
    is a shortage of tradesman in  many regions capable
    of building housing fast enough to a lid on prices. 
    Many young people view trades jobs as dangerous, low
    status and thus unappealing.
<h2>Apps</h2>
<h2>Trailers</h2>
Travel trailers are towed by other vehicles, usually
    cars or pickup trucks. They are used commonly by
    holiday-makers and remote sport enthusiasts (such as
    for fishing / surfers / rock climbers). Because they
    are usually built to driven by a single person driving
    one vehicle, and are used for temporary living (few
    days to a few weeks), they are build to be self-contained
    units that contain sleeping + living + cooking space
    all in one 'box'. However, for permanent living combined
    with afore-mentioned sharing-economy apps, the typical
    family who owns a home or rents an apartment 
    could switch to owning multiple specialized trailers.

<h2>Parking</h2>
<h3>Distributed Trailers</h3>
The trailers do not all have to be parked at the same location.
    For example, a middle class family might choose to spend
    weekdays in the city and only bring along a minimal set of
    trailers. The rest would be at a plot in further out, and the
    minimal set might be towed out to the plot on friday evenings
    and towed back to city on sunday evenings
<h3>City Locations</h3>
<ul><li>Multi-story parking lots</li>
<li>Shopping mall and big-box store parking</li>
<li>Private drive-ways / curbsides rented out</li></ul>
<h3>Rural Locations</h3>
<ul><li>RV parks</li>
<li>Farm-land temporarily rented out</li>
<li>National park land campsites</li>
<li>Sides of rural roads</li></ul>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<h2>Robo-Vehicles</h2>
When self-driving car technology  becomes
    commercially available, the cost of the drivers can
    be eliminated. Often, even the cost of parking can
    be eliminated, as the robo-trailers can roam around
    without stopping.
<h2>Business Opportunities</h2>
<ul><li>Auto manufacturers would have a large new market.
          Instead of selling one vehicle per person, they could
          be selling 5+ vehicles per person.</li>
<li>Uber could have division for trailer transportation</li>
<li>Airbnb could host and finance accomodations that 
          continually shift to seasons and feastivals / events</li>
<li>Task Rabbit could encourage an influx of freelance
          trailer-focused mechanics, plumbers, and cleaners
          on it's platform</li>
<li>Car Parks could double their revenue by having 
          night-time vehicles (the trailers), a time when they are
          usually empty</li>
<li>RV parks would see massive new surge of customers at all
          times of the years. RV parks usually only get customers
          in the summer, and only a small slice of that
          vacationer market. Most vacationers 
          choose hotels / motels.</li></ul><h3>Keywords</h3>
